How to Run Your New Workflow
- Make sure your knowledge_base is populated and you have run ingest.py at least once.
- Run the main script: python process_rfp.py
- When prompted, enter the name of your sample RFP file: sample_rfp.txt.
- The script will call the "Outliner" and show you the extracted JSON. Review it.
- Type yes and press Enter to approve.
- The script will then call the "Responder" for each question and assemble the final document.
- Check your folder for a new file named RFP_Response.md containing the complete, structured answer!
